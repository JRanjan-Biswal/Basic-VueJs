--------- PROPS -------

1. props are the values that can be passed to a component so that it renders according to the data passed.
2. props are analogous to arguments passed to a function.
3. Just like a generic function can behave differently according to the arguments passed, a component can also render differently according to the props passed. This enables you to define a generic component that can be used differently by passing the relevant data accordingly.
4. props is an array of all the data elements that can be passed to a component.
5. EXAMPLE: --
   ```js
   const dummyComponent = {
   template: `<p> {{ prop1 }} and {{ prop2 }} are passed to the dummyComponent. </p>`,
   props: ['prop1', 'prop2'],
   }
   ```

6. props are passed using the HTML-like syntax where the prop name is set as an HTML element property and its value is assigned by using the assignment operator =. The syntax of passing a prop is shown in the following code snippet.
   EXAMPLE: --
   ```js
   <ComponentName propName="value"/>
   ```
