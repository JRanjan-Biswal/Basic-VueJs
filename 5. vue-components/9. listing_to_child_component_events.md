1. In most cases the parent component and child component have there own data variables and methods. But sometimes the child component need to communicate with parent component.
   there we use `$emit.`

#### <u><center> $emit </u></center>

1. In order to make the parent component listen to the child, the child component must initiate an event using the `＄ emit` method.

2. The `＄ emit` method is used with a v-on directive that emits the event on another event like a mouse click or a keypress. You can name the event that is to be emitted on your own. The following code snippet shows how an event can be emitted.

3. e.g. : --

    ```js
    <button v-on:click="$emit('event_name')"></button>
    ```

4. Remember: The responsibility of catching and handling the emitted event lies with the parent component. The child component may not have an event handler or method related to that event.

###### <u><center> Handling the emitted event# </u></center>

1. The parent component can listen for the event that the child emitted. The event will be identified by the name from which it was emitted by the child component.
2. The v-on directive is used again to catch the event and call the handler method.
3. The following code snippet shows the event emitter from the child component and how it can be handled in the parent component.
4. eg.

```js
<!-- Event emitted from the child component -->
<button v-on:click="$emit('event_name')"></button>

<!-- Event caught and handled in the parent component -->
<ParentComponent v-on:event_name='handlerFunction'>
```

###### <u><center> Emitting Value With an Event </u></center>

1.

```js
<button @click="$emit('search_post', nameToSearch)"> Search </button>
```
