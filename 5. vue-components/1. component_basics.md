1. Vue.js provides a way to divide the entire web application into small, modular, and individually manageable parts called components. 
2. Each component has its own structure (template), variables (data), and functions (methods). 

3. Vue offers the flexibility to define components in separate files. These files have the .vue extension and contain everything related to that component. .vue files contain three main parts:
        3.1 > ```<template>```
        3.2 > ```<script>```
        3.3 > ```<style>```

4. The entire application logic and other components reside within the App component. 

5. In the Vue.js project, all the components of the app are fused together using a vanilla JavaScript file which imports Vue and the main component. This is often called App. So, App becomes the center point of the entire application. This App component is rendered through the render() function in the main JavaScript file which is often called main.js.
    e.g. : ==> 
    ```
    import Vue from "vue";
    import App from "./App.vue";

    new Vue({
        render: h => h(App)
    }).$mount("#app");

    ```
6. ###### IMPORTANT: ===> Remember: data must be a function that returns the variables in components.



--------- GLOBAL VS LOCAL SCOPE ----------

1. If wanting to save the effort of importing and declaring components every time, register them via the Vue.component() method in the main JavaScript file. This method is shown in the application below.
```
    import ToggleSwitch from './ToggleSwitch.vue';
    Vue.component('ToggleSwitch', ToggleSwitch);
```
