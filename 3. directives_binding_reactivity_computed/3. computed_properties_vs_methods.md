COMPUTED PROPERTIES

1. they are simple getter's. We can also used methods for the same. But the difference is that computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies.

2. A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its reactive dependencies have changed.

3. this actually means the value from the computed propeties, will be immediately returned from the previos computed result. e.g.
```js
computed: {
  now() {
    return Date.now()
  }
}
```
note: This also means the following computed property will never update, because Date.now() is not a reactive dependency.

4. IMPORTANT: In comparison, a method invocation will always run the function whenever a re-render happens.

5. Computed properties are by default getter-only. If you attempt to assign a new value to a computed property, you will receive a runtime warning.

6. It is important to remember that computed getter functions should only perform pure computation and be free of side effects. For example, don't make async requests or mutate the DOM inside a computed getter! 

7. Think of a computed property as declaratively describing how to derive a value based on other values - its only responsibility should be computing and returning that value.
