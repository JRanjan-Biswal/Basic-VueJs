## <u><center> REACTIVE LIST RENDERING </u></center>

1. As we know, the template of a Vue instance binds to the data properties so that any change in data properties is automatically reflected in the DOM. 
2. Similarly, the v-for directive binds the element to the array which it renders.
3. If an array in the data is updated, the elements based on it will reflect the changes and re-render according to the updated array.
4. Vue has a mechanism that triggers the DOM updates when certain array update methods are called. The methods on which Vue reacts are listed below.
5. Whenever an array is mutated through any of these methods, the Vue updates the DOM as well.
6. Default reactive array updating methods are:
    6.1. `push()`
    6.2. `pop()`
    6.3. `shift()`
    6.4. `unshift()`
    6.5. `splice()`
    6.6. `reverse()`
    6.7. `sort()`


#### <u><center> NON REACTIVE LIST RENDERING </u></center>

1. The above mentioned update functions are important because the other ways that update the arrays do not trigger DOM updates.
2. For example, by changing an element from an array using regular indexing such as `array[index] = 'y'`, the change will not be reflected in the rendered DOM due to some limitations of JavaScript.
