------ KEEPING STATE -------

1. When an array is updated, Vue uses an in-place patch update strategy to make updating more efficient and faster. 
2. However, this behavior does not suit certain scenarios when requiring an identity for each element in the list so that Vue can change the references instead of doing an in-place patch. 
3. For example, if the list contains large-sized objects and its order is changed, the changes can be reflected by only updating the order of the HTML elements. 
4. However, by default Vue will update each HTML element separately until it matches the updated array.
5. The in-place patch, in this case, would be slow. The key attribute allows Vue to track the elementâ€™s identity and thus reordering and reusing existing elements. This makes the updates significantly faster.

```js
<div v-for="item in items" v-bind:key="item.id">
  <!-- content -->
</div>
```
