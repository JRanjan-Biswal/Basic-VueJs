--- MOUSE EVENTS ---

1. v-on:click
2. The mouse click event is one of the most used events on webpages when surfing the internet.
3. When users click on a button or any other HTML element, they expect it to do something.
4. This means that the click event performs action. 
5. That action might involve interaction with the data.
6. The Vue.js click event is similar to the onclick event in vanilla JavaScript but it provides additional functionality.
7. When the function defined in methods is assigned to the click handler, it can also accept arguments as a regular function call in JavaScript. 
8. Note: The shorthand for v-on:click is @click.



--- KEYBOARD EVENT ---

1. v-on:keyup
2. The v-on directive can also listen for the keyboard events other than the mouse.
3. To listen for keyboard events, the keyup handler is used. 
4. One difference between keyboard and mouse event handlers is that in mouse events, any button on the mouse can be pressed to trigger the event. However, keyboard events need to specify the key for which you need to listen. 
5. For example, you can trigger an event only when the enter key is pressed. Similarly, you can specify a series of keys to listen to as well.
6. SYNTAX : <input v-on:keyup.enter="showMessage" v-model="message" placeholder="Write the message here...">
7. As you used .enter to listen for the Enter key, there are more commonly used keys that can be listened to using their identifiers or aliases.
8. The keys and their aliases are listed below.
        8.1. > .enter for Enter
        8.2. > .tab for Tab
        8.3. > .delete Delete and Backspace
        8.4. > .esc for Escape
        8.5. > .space for Space
        8.6. > .up for Arrow Up
        8.7. > .down for Arrow Down
        8.8. > .left for Arrow Left
        8.9. > .right for Arrow Right

9. ======== v-on:keyup with multiple keys =========
    9.1. > Concatenate the key aliases with v-on:keyup event handler so that the event can only be triggered when the keys will be pressed in a specific order. 
    9.2. > For example, submit a form by pressing “Shift+Enter” keys. Use the .shift.enter alias chain with v-on:keyup.
    9.3. > <input v-on:keyup.shift.enter="showMessage" v-model="message" placeholder="Write the message here...">
