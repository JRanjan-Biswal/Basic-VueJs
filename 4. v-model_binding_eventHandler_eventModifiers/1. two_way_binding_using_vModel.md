## ---------- TWO WAY BINDING -----------

1. In front-end development, handling user input is one of the most complicated tasks because it involves multiple steps to achieve a goal that is as simple as displaying the user input on another part of the webpage.

2. Vue makes the process of obtaining user input simple and intuitive by binding the data variables directly to the user input. It automatically updates the value of the related variable when the user enters the data.

## ------------ V MODEL - DIRECTIVE --------

1. The v-model directive is used to bind any variable to the user input. It binds the data to the formâ€™s input elements reactively which means that the data gets updated as soon as any change happens with the input.
2. Following is the list of form input elements that can be bound to data using the v-model directive. : --
   2.1 > Text
   2.2 > Multiline text
   2.3 > Checkbox
   2.4 > Radio button
   2.5 > Selection list
3. Note :----> Internally, v-model uses different properties and emits different events to keep everything updated. It is just syntactic sugar and offers a level of abstraction for the ease of the developer.

#### ------------- TEXT ----------------

1. The text input is used when a user wants to enter a small text such as a name or email address.
2. e.g.
```js
   new Vue({
        el: "#app",
        template:
            `<div>
                <h1>Vue.js Application</h1>
                <input v-model="name" placeholder="Write name here...">
                <p>Your name is: {{ name }} </p>
            </div>
            `,
        data: {
            name: "",
        },
   });
```

#### ------------- MULTILINE TEXT -------------
1. Longer text inputs may require the user to enter multiple lines of text.
2. e.g.
```js
    new Vue({
        el: '#app',
        template:
            `<div>
                <h1>Vue.js Application</h1>
                <textarea v-model="letter_content" placeholder="Add multiple lines"></textarea>
                <br>
                <span>Multiline message is:</span>
                <p style="white-space: pre-line;">{{ letter_content }}</p>
            </div>
            `,
            data: {
                letter_content: ''
            }
    })
```
