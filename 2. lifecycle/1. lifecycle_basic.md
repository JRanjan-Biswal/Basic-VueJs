## <u><center>Lifecycle</u></center>

1. When a Vue instance is created, it passes through a process comprising of several steps termed as lifecycle. This lifecycle continues until the instance is terminated. There are several steps in this cycle that are required to be understood to use their functionality. 

2. When a Vue instance is created, Vue does a great job of binding data and methods which makes our views reactive and keeps the real DOM in sync with the virtual DOM. This whole process of Vue.js is carried out in the Vue instance lifecycle.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This cycle is divided into four main stages :-
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2.1 Create
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2.2 Mount
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2.3 Update
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2.4 Delete

3. In the create step, the instance is initialized along with events, injections, and reactivity. 

After the initialization, the mount stage starts which replaces the target div with the template of the Vue instance. 

After a Vue instance is mounted, it begins to update according to the data and methods. 
Then, the virtual DOM is re-rendered and patched. This is called the update stage. 

Lastly, when the instanceâ€™s lifetime is completed, the destroy stage begins. This stage is responsible for freeing up resources, deleting variables, and cleaning up the components.
